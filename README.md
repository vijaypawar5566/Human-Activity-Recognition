# Human-Activity-Recognition

• The Project aims at constructing a classification model which identify the activity done by the person.
• Engaged with a challenging dataset provided by WISDM Lab of Fordham University. The dataset involved data collected from the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors of a smartphone and smartwatch, capturing the movements of 51 subjects as they performed 18 diverse activities of daily living. Each activity  executed for a duration of 3 minutes.
• Used Amazone S3 bucket to store the data and implemeted using pypark on Databricks and pandas to clean the data as well as the machine learning tools like sklearn , matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.
• Decision trees, logistic regression, random forest, and K-nearest neighbors (KNN), along with convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) employed to train on the data. Among these models, KNN achieved an accuracy of 0.76.
